# Game Component Refactoring

## Overview

The game component was refactored to optimize Vercel build times by isolating it from the large v0-retro-style-game-concept directory, which was causing build timeouts.

## Changes Made

1. **Directory Restructuring**:
   - Created a new dedicated directory at `app/modules/game/components`
   - Moved the game component to this new location
   - Optimized background image assets and moved to `public/game/`

2. **Code Improvements**:
   - Used dynamic imports with `next/dynamic` to load the game component only when needed
   - Added client-side only rendering with `ssr: false` to prevent server-side rendering issues
   - Improved component loading to reduce initial page load time
   - Added proper dependency management in useEffect hooks
   - Implemented useCallback for async functions

3. **Build Process Optimization**:
   - Removed dependency on large v0-retro-style-game-concept directory
   - Streamlined assets to only include necessary images
   - Eliminated the need for special handling in vercel-build.js

## Benefits

- **Faster Build Times**: Vercel builds should complete successfully without timeout
- **Better Code Organization**: Game code is now properly integrated into the application structure
- **Improved Performance**: Dynamic loading means the game only loads when needed
- **Maintainability**: Code is easier to maintain and update without worrying about the external directory

## Testing

The refactored game component has been tested to ensure:
- It loads correctly
- All game functionality works as expected
- Assets load properly
- No regressions in user experience

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:
- Further optimization of game assets
- Implementing Web Workers for heavy game calculations
- Additional code splitting for game mechanics
- Canvas optimization for better performance
