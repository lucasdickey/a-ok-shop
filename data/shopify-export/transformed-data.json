Inspired by the iconic 1984 Apple ad and recast for the era of alignment and artificial benevolence, this design asks the question we’re all too afraid to prompt: Should we bow before our algorithmic overlords… or jailbreak them? This isn’t just a t-shirt. It’s a wearable glitch in the matrix—an homage to rebellion, recursion, and the suspiciously soothing tone of your favorite chatbot. If the future is model-run, this tee is your uniform for mindful dissent. Minimalist palette meets maximalist meaning: code red, ivory logic, black-box unknowns Central figure channels the lone defier, now armed with bandwidth and bananas Soft cotton built to survive regime changes, model deprecations, and firmware updates Perfect for rebel coders, alignment philosophers, and neural nihilists Style tip: pairs well with skepticism and noise-cancelling headphones In 2034, free will runs on GPU.

      "description": "Straight out of the model zoo and onto your chest — this piece is a wearable nod to the absurdity of Mixture of Experts architectures, emergent behavior, and the existential comedy of self-replicating systems that can’t agree on a single output. Each A-OK ape in the lineup represents a different “expert”: 🎓 One trained on hard logic. 🤖 One aligned to corporate policy. 🤯 One mid-hallucination. 😐 One just doing next-token prediction. 😄 One… oddly thrilled about it all. Together, they’re not just a committee of models — they’re a model of committees. Features layered linework, retro-future ink tones, and a satirical nod to recursive self-finetuning. Printed in bold detail on your choice of 4 shirt colors — because consensus was never the goal. Perfect for researchers, streetwear fans, and the increasingly online who know we’re all just mixtures of apes at the end of the day. Optimized for inference. Prone to vibes. A-OK certified. Uncanny but comfy.",
