This is a NextJS app with an embedded game imported from another repo we own (v0-retro-style-game-concept) and a service call to the self-replicating art API.

The game is a simple Pac-Man and Snake hybrid where the player must navigate a maze while avoiding obstacles and collecting power pellets. The game is played on a canvas element and the player controls a character using the arrow keys.

**NEW: Game Reward System**
The game now features a discount code reward system. When players win the game (collect 3 UBI Credits), they are presented with an overlay containing a 25% discount code for the A-OK Store. The discount system supports both mock codes (development) and real Shopify discount codes (with Admin API configuration).

This app is a proof of concept for a potential future product where users can purchase a t-shirt with a unique design that is generated by the self-replicating art API. The design will be generated based on the user's preferences and the design will be unique to each user.

This app uses the Shopify GraphQL APIs for facilitating product and catalog access - including images and metadata - to fill a cart and ultimately checkout. It also includes an optional Shopify Admin API integration for creating real discount codes.

The game and the ImageGrid Chaos Monkey images are a proof of concept for more content and interaction in a retail setting.
