This is a NextJS app with an embedded game inmported from another repo we own (v0-retro-style-game-concept) and a service call to the self-replicating art API.

The game is a simple Pac-Man and Snake hybrid where the player must navigate a maze while avoiding obstacles and collecting power pellets. The game is played on a canvas element and the player controls a character using the arrow keys.

This app is a proof of concept for a potential future product where users can purchase a t-shirt with a unique design that is generated by the self-replicating art API. The design will be generated based on the user's preferences and the design will be unique to each user.

This app uses the Shopify GraphQL APIs for faciliating product and catalog access - including images and metadata - to fill a cart and ultimately checkout.

The game and the ImageGrid Chaose Monkey images are a proof of concept for more content and interaction in a retail setting.
